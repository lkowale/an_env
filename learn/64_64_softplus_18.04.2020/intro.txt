digging into model_128_3_b4
after doing validation curve it appearas its overfitting as well
ahould be doing some regularization

looking at validation vizualistaion model selection 12.06.2019_0/Figure_1.png for validation mae is still 10 worse than learn
even after adding kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001) to first layer
13.06
decided for 64x64 mlp with regularization and 5000 epochs, want to see validation curve
its valiation curve is rising after 500 epoch for model with or without regularization.
model without has best (but still not the best) score than those with regularization or dropout in range form 0.5 to 0.05

changed activation func from relu to elu helped

cheking different activation functions on 32_32 model - the best on 1000 epochs is softplus

after doing validation curve it seems a good choise - training and validation curves are close together, although
mae validation curve starts rising after 2200 epoch
